# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for migrating HalluciFix from Supabase to Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. The migration will leverage AWS services to provide scalable, secure, and cost-effective infrastructure for the AI accuracy verification platform while maintaining all existing functionality and improving performance capabilities.

## Glossary

- **HalluciFix_System**: The AI accuracy verification platform that detects hallucinations in AI-generated content
- **AWS_Infrastructure**: Amazon Web Services cloud platform providing compute, storage, database, and AI/ML services
- **Migration_Process**: The systematic transition from Supabase to AWS services
- **Content_Analysis_Engine**: The core AI component that processes and analyzes content for hallucinations
- **User_Authentication_Service**: AWS Cognito-based authentication and authorization system
- **Database_Service**: AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance replacing Supabase database
- **API_Gateway**: AWS API Gateway managing REST and GraphQL endpoints
- **Serverless_Functions**: AWS Lambda functions replacing Supabase Edge Functions
- **File_Storage_Service**: AWS S3 for document and media file storage
- **CDN_Service**: AWS CloudFront for content delivery and caching
- **Monitoring_Service**: AWS CloudWatch for application and infrastructure monitoring
- **AI_Services**: AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, or other AI/ML services for content analysis

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate the authentication system to AWS Cognito, so that users can continue accessing the platform with enhanced security features and scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to authenticate, THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL process login requests through AWS Cognito
2. THE HalluciFix_System SHALL maintain all existing user accounts during migration without data loss
3. THE User_Authentication_Service SHALL support OAuth integration with Google Drive and other third-party services
4. THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL provide multi-factor authentication capabilities for enhanced security
5. WHERE users have existing sessions, THE Migration_Process SHALL preserve active authentication states

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate the database from Supabase to AWS RDS, so that we can leverage AWS database optimization features and maintain data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Database_Service SHALL use PostgreSQL engine compatible with existing schema and queries
2. WHEN migrating data, THE Migration_Process SHALL preserve all existing tables, indexes, and relationships
3. THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL provide automated backups and point-in-time recovery capabilities
4. THE Database_Service SHALL support read replicas for improved query performance
5. WHERE database connections are established, THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL implement connection pooling for optimal resource utilization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content analyst, I want the AI analysis functionality to leverage AWS AI services, so that content processing is faster and more accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Content_Analysis_Engine SHALL integrate with AWS Bedrock or SageMaker for AI model inference
2. WHEN processing batch analysis requests, THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL scale compute resources automatically
3. THE AI_Services SHALL maintain or improve current accuracy scores for hallucination detection
4. THE Serverless_Functions SHALL process analysis requests with sub-second response times for single content
5. WHERE large documents are analyzed, THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL support parallel processing capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an application user, I want file uploads and storage to use AWS S3, so that document processing is reliable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE File_Storage_Service SHALL accept PDF, text, and other document formats currently supported
2. WHEN users upload files, THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL provide secure pre-signed URLs for direct uploads
3. THE CDN_Service SHALL cache frequently accessed documents for improved performance
4. THE File_Storage_Service SHALL implement lifecycle policies for cost optimization
5. WHERE files contain sensitive data, THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL encrypt data at rest and in transit

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging through AWS CloudWatch, so that I can maintain system health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Monitoring_Service SHALL track all API requests, response times, and error rates
2. WHEN system anomalies occur, THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL send automated alerts to administrators
3. THE Monitoring_Service SHALL provide dashboards for real-time system performance metrics
4. THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL retain logs for compliance and debugging purposes
5. WHERE performance thresholds are exceeded, THE Monitoring_Service SHALL trigger auto-scaling actions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want to replace Supabase Edge Functions with AWS Lambda, so that serverless compute scales automatically and integrates with other AWS services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Serverless_Functions SHALL handle scheduled scans, webhook processing, and background tasks
2. WHEN function execution demand increases, THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL scale Lambda instances automatically
3. THE API_Gateway SHALL route requests to appropriate Lambda functions with proper authentication
4. THE Serverless_Functions SHALL maintain existing functionality for scan-executor and billing operations
5. WHERE functions require external integrations, THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL provide secure credential management

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want cost optimization features implemented across AWS services, so that infrastructure costs remain predictable and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL implement auto-scaling policies to optimize resource utilization
2. WHEN traffic is low, THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL scale down resources to minimize costs
3. THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL use appropriate instance types and storage classes for workload requirements
4. THE Monitoring_Service SHALL provide cost tracking and budget alerts
5. WHERE possible, THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL leverage spot instances and reserved capacity for cost savings

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want AWS security best practices implemented, so that the platform maintains high security standards and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL implement least privilege access using IAM roles and policies
2. WHEN data is transmitted, THE AWS_Infrastructure SHALL use TLS encryption for all communications
