# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves establishing a comprehensive testing framework covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability of the HalluciFix application. The testing strategy will provide confidence in deployments, catch regressions early, and support continuous integration workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit testing coverage, so that I can confidently refactor code and catch bugs early in the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL have unit tests for all utilities, services, and business logic with 80%+ code coverage
2. WHEN testing React components THEN the system SHALL use React Testing Library for component testing with proper accessibility testing
3. WHEN testing custom hooks THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive hook testing with proper state management validation
4. WHEN mocking dependencies THEN the system SHALL use consistent mocking patterns with MSW for API mocking
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration testing for API and database operations, so that I can ensure different parts of the system work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing API integrations THEN the system SHALL test with real service endpoints using test environments
2. WHEN testing database operations THEN the system SHALL use test database with proper data isolation and cleanup
3. WHEN testing authentication flows THEN the system SHALL test complete OAuth and session management workflows
4. WHEN testing file operations THEN the system SHALL test file upload, processing, and Google Drive integration
5. IF integration tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and system state for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want end-to-end testing for critical user journeys, so that I can ensure the application works correctly from a user perspective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing user workflows THEN the system SHALL test complete user journeys from authentication to analysis completion
2. WHEN testing across browsers THEN the system SHALL support cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
3. WHEN testing responsive design THEN the system SHALL test mobile and desktop viewports
4. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL include performance benchmarks and regression detection
5. IF E2E tests fail THEN the system SHALL capture screenshots, videos, and detailed failure information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want testing infrastructure integrated with CI/CD, so that tests run automatically and prevent broken code from being deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN the system SHALL automatically run all relevant tests in CI/CD pipeline
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide detailed failure reports
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL support parallel test execution for faster feedback
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide test coverage reports and trend analysis
5. IF CI/CD tests fail THEN the system SHALL notify developers with actionable failure information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and accessibility testing, so that the application meets quality standards and provides a good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL measure and validate Core Web Vitals and response times
2. WHEN testing accessibility THEN the system SHALL validate WCAG compliance and screen reader compatibility
3. WHEN testing under load THEN the system SHALL simulate realistic user loads and measure system behavior
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL detect regressions and alert developers
5. IF accessibility issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance for remediation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test data management, so that tests are reliable, isolated, and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide consistent test data through factories and fixtures
2. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL clean up test data to prevent interference between tests
3. WHEN seeding test data THEN the system SHALL support realistic data scenarios for comprehensive testing
4. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN the system SHALL ensure test data isolation and prevent conflicts
5. IF test data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to reset and restore clean test state
