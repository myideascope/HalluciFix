# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves implementing comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting infrastructure to ensure system reliability, performance tracking, and proactive issue detection in production environments. The system will provide structured logging, application performance monitoring, error tracking, and comprehensive alerting capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured logging throughout the application, so that I can effectively debug issues and monitor application behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application events occur THEN the system SHALL log events in structured JSON format with consistent schema
2. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL include contextual information (user ID, request ID, session ID, timestamp)
3. WHEN different log levels are needed THEN the system SHALL support configurable log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
4. WHEN logs are generated THEN the system SHALL aggregate logs centrally with proper retention and rotation policies
5. IF sensitive information is logged THEN the system SHALL sanitize and protect sensitive data from exposure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive application performance monitoring, so that I can track system health and identify performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring application performance THEN the system SHALL track key performance indicators (response times, throughput, error rates)
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL monitor endpoint performance and track Core Web Vitals
3. WHEN database queries execute THEN the system SHALL monitor query performance and identify slow operations
4. WHEN user interactions occur THEN the system SHALL track user journey performance and conversion metrics
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error tracking, so that I can quickly identify, diagnose, and resolve application errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL automatically capture and report errors with full context and stack traces
2. WHEN similar errors happen THEN the system SHALL group and deduplicate errors for efficient analysis
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL send real-time alerts to the development team
4. WHEN analyzing errors THEN the system SHALL provide error trends, frequency analysis, and impact assessment
5. IF errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL track error resolution and prevent regression

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive system health monitoring, so that I can ensure system reliability and uptime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL track infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
2. WHEN services are running THEN the system SHALL perform health checks and monitor service availability
3. WHEN external dependencies are used THEN the system SHALL monitor third-party service health and response times
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL alert on resource usage thresholds
5. IF system outages occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed incident tracking and resolution support

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want business metrics monitoring, so that I can track application usage and business performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the application THEN the system SHALL track user engagement and feature usage metrics
2. WHEN business events occur THEN the system SHALL log and analyze conversion rates, user retention, and growth metrics
3. WHEN analyzing business performance THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards with key business indicators
4. WHEN trends change THEN the system SHALL detect and alert on significant business metric changes
5. IF business goals are not met THEN the system SHALL provide insights and recommendations for improvement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated alerting and incident response, so that issues are detected and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system issues occur THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and alert on problems based on configurable thresholds
2. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL send notifications through multiple channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
3. WHEN incidents happen THEN the system SHALL create incident records with severity levels and escalation procedures
4. WHEN alerts are resolved THEN the system SHALL track resolution time and provide post-incident analysis
5. IF alert fatigue occurs THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent alerting with noise reduction and prioritization
