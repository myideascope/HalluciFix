# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves implementing comprehensive error handling throughout the application including React error boundaries, API error handling, user-friendly error messages, and robust error recovery mechanisms. The system will provide graceful error recovery, detailed error logging, and excellent user experience even when errors occur.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue using the application even when unexpected errors occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages instead of crashing the entire application
2. WHEN component errors happen THEN the system SHALL isolate errors using React error boundaries with appropriate fallback UI
3. WHEN errors are recoverable THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms and recovery actions for users
4. WHEN displaying errors THEN the system SHALL show helpful error messages with clear next steps for resolution
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain core functionality while gracefully degrading affected features

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when API calls fail, so that I understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL categorize errors (network, authentication, validation, server) and display appropriate messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL detect connectivity issues and provide offline-friendly messaging
3. WHEN authentication errors happen THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt token refresh or prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
5. IF API errors persist THEN the system SHALL provide alternative actions or graceful degradation options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want form validation errors to be clear and actionable, so that I can quickly correct my input and complete my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL display field-level error messages with specific guidance
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic fields with appropriate visual indicators
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL announce errors with proper ARIA labels and live regions
4. WHEN validation happens THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback to prevent submission errors
5. IF input constraints exist THEN the system SHALL communicate requirements clearly and prevent invalid input

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized error management, so that I can monitor application health and quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context for debugging
2. WHEN categorizing errors THEN the system SHALL classify errors by type, severity, and impact for proper handling
3. WHEN errors are frequent THEN the system SHALL provide error analytics and trend reporting
4. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL send notifications and alerts to development team
5. IF error patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL provide insights for proactive issue resolution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error monitoring, so that I can maintain system reliability and user satisfaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring errors THEN the system SHALL integrate with error tracking services (Sentry) for comprehensive reporting
2. WHEN errors impact users THEN the system SHALL track error rates, user impact, and recovery success rates
3. WHEN system health degrades THEN the system SHALL provide real-time alerting and notification systems
4. WHEN analyzing errors THEN the system SHALL provide error dashboards with actionable insights
5. IF error thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger automated incident response procedures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to recover from errors automatically when possible, so that my workflow is minimally disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transient errors occur THEN the system SHALL automatically retry failed operations with appropriate backoff strategies
2. WHEN components crash THEN the system SHALL provide reset mechanisms to restore functionality without full page reload
3. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically resume failed operations
4. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL clear error states and return to normal operation
5. IF automatic recovery fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual recovery options with clear instructions
