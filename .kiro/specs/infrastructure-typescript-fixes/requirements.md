# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic resolution of 183 TypeScript compilation errors across 21 files in the HalluciFix infrastructure codebase. The errors span multiple categories including incorrect AWS CDK API usage, missing imports, readonly property violations, deprecated properties, and type mismatches. The goal is to achieve a fully compilable TypeScript infrastructure codebase while maintaining functionality and following AWS CDK best practices.

## Glossary

- **Infrastructure_Codebase**: The AWS CDK TypeScript code located in the infrastructure directory that defines cloud resources
- **Compilation_Error**: TypeScript compiler errors that prevent successful build and deployment
- **AWS_CDK**: Amazon Web Services Cloud Development Kit for infrastructure as code
- **Stack_File**: Individual TypeScript files that define AWS CDK stacks (e.g., performance-testing-stack.ts)
- **Import_Resolution**: The process of correctly importing modules and dependencies
- **API_Compatibility**: Ensuring code uses current and correct AWS CDK API methods and properties
- **Type_Safety**: Maintaining TypeScript's type checking capabilities throughout the codebase

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all TypeScript files in the infrastructure codebase to compile successfully, so that I can deploy the infrastructure without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript compiler runs on the infrastructure codebase, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL compile without any TypeScript errors
2. WHEN running `npx tsc --noEmit` in the infrastructure directory, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL return exit code 0
3. WHEN all fixes are applied, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL maintain all existing functionality
4. WHEN compilation succeeds, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL be ready for CDK deployment commands
5. WHEN fixes are implemented, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL follow current AWS CDK best practices

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import statements and module references to be correctly resolved, so that the TypeScript compiler can find all dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript processes import statements, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL resolve all module imports successfully
2. WHEN missing imports are identified, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL include all required import statements
3. WHEN incorrect module paths are found, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL use correct relative and absolute import paths
4. WHEN AWS SDK imports are used, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL import from the correct AWS SDK v3 modules
5. WHEN CDK imports are referenced, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL use the current aws-cdk-lib import structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cloud architect, I want all AWS CDK API usage to be current and correct, so that the infrastructure code uses supported and non-deprecated methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS CDK constructs are instantiated, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL use current API methods and properties
2. WHEN CloudWatch actions are needed, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL import SnsAction from aws-events-targets instead of aws-cloudwatch
3. WHEN deprecated properties are found, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL replace them with current equivalents
4. WHEN construct properties are set, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL use only supported property names
5. WHEN AWS service integrations are configured, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL use the latest CDK patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a TypeScript developer, I want all property assignments to respect readonly constraints, so that the code follows proper TypeScript patterns and object immutability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN readonly properties are encountered, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL not attempt direct assignment to readonly properties
2. WHEN class properties need initialization, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL use constructor initialization or proper setter methods
3. WHEN CDK construct properties are readonly, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL configure them through constructor parameters
4. WHEN property modifications are needed, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL use appropriate methods instead of direct assignment
5. WHEN immutable objects are used, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL respect their immutability constraints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want all type annotations and generic types to be correctly specified, so that TypeScript can provide proper type checking and IntelliSense support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN function parameters are used, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL include explicit type annotations where TypeScript cannot infer types
2. WHEN generic types are required, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL specify appropriate type parameters
3. WHEN AWS SDK types are used, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL import and use the correct type definitions
4. WHEN callback functions are defined, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL properly type all parameters
5. WHEN complex object types are used, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL define or import appropriate interfaces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the infrastructure code to maintain all existing functionality after fixes, so that no features are broken during the error resolution process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compilation errors are fixed, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL preserve all original functionality
2. WHEN API methods are updated, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL maintain equivalent behavior
3. WHEN property names are changed, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL ensure the same configuration is applied
4. WHEN imports are corrected, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL maintain access to all required functionality
5. WHEN type fixes are applied, THE Infrastructure_Codebase SHALL not alter runtime behavior
