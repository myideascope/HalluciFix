# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for completely rewriting and modernizing all GitHub Actions test workflows for the HalluciFix application. The current testing infrastructure needs to be rebuilt from the ground up to provide comprehensive, reliable, and efficient testing coverage across all application layers.

## Glossary

- **GitHub_Actions**: The CI/CD platform used for automated testing and deployment workflows
- **Test_Suite**: A collection of related tests that validate specific functionality
- **Coverage_Threshold**: The minimum percentage of code that must be covered by tests
- **Test_Parallelization**: Running multiple tests simultaneously to reduce execution time
- **Regression_Detection**: Automated identification of performance or functionality degradation
- **Test_Artifacts**: Files generated during test execution (reports, coverage data, screenshots)
- **Quality_Gate**: Automated checks that must pass before code can be merged or deployed

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test automation in GitHub Actions, so that I can ensure code quality and catch issues before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main or develop branches, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL execute the complete test suite automatically
2. WHEN a pull request is created, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL run targeted tests based on changed files
3. WHEN tests fail, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL prevent deployment and notify the development team
4. WHEN all tests pass, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL generate coverage reports and performance metrics
5. WHERE test execution exceeds 15 minutes, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL implement parallel execution to reduce runtime

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want multi-layered testing coverage, so that I can validate functionality at unit, integration, and end-to-end levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL execute unit tests with minimum 80% code coverage
2. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL run integration tests against real database and API endpoints
3. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL perform end-to-end tests across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
4. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL validate mobile responsiveness and accessibility compliance
5. WHEN critical modules are modified, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL require 90% coverage threshold

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want intelligent test optimization, so that I can minimize CI/CD pipeline execution time while maintaining quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN only specific files are changed, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL execute only relevant test suites
2. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL cache dependencies and test results to reduce setup time
3. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL run tests in parallel across multiple runners when possible
4. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL skip redundant test execution for unchanged code paths
5. WHERE test history indicates flaky tests, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL retry failed tests up to 3 times

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want comprehensive test reporting and notifications, so that I can track quality metrics and respond to issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL generate detailed test reports with pass/fail status for each test suite
2. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL create coverage reports with trend analysis over time
3. WHEN tests fail, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL send notifications via Slack and create GitHub issues
4. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL publish test dashboards accessible to all team members
5. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL track performance regression and alert when thresholds are exceeded

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want security and compliance testing integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, so that I can ensure the application meets security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL perform security vulnerability scanning on dependencies
2. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL validate environment variable security and encryption
3. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL run accessibility compliance tests (WCAG 2.1 AA)
4. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL check for sensitive data exposure in test outputs
5. WHERE security vulnerabilities are detected, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL block deployment and create security alerts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want automated performance testing, so that I can detect performance regressions before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL execute performance benchmarks for critical user journeys
2. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL measure and track bundle size changes over time
3. WHEN performance metrics exceed baseline thresholds, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL fail the build
4. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL generate performance reports with historical trend analysis
5. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL validate Core Web Vitals metrics meet acceptable standards

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test environment management, so that I can run tests in isolated, reproducible environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL provision isolated test databases for each test run
2. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL manage test data seeding and cleanup automatically
3. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL provide consistent environment variables across all test environments
4. WHEN tests require external services, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL use mocked or containerized versions
5. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL ensure test environment teardown to prevent resource leaks

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want test result analytics and insights, so that I can identify patterns and improve testing effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL track test execution time trends and identify slow tests
2. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL identify flaky tests and provide failure pattern analysis
3. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL generate weekly test health reports with actionable insights
4. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL measure test coverage trends and highlight coverage gaps
5. WHERE test patterns indicate quality issues, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL recommend improvements
