# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves optimizing database performance through proper indexing, query optimization, and schema improvements to support large-scale usage and ensure fast response times for all database operations. The system will provide efficient data access, proper indexing strategies, and comprehensive performance monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast application response times, so that I can efficiently analyze content and access my data without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing database queries THEN the system SHALL execute all queries in less than 100ms (95th percentile)
2. WHEN accessing frequently used data THEN the system SHALL utilize proper indexing to ensure optimal query performance
3. WHEN loading dashboard data THEN the system SHALL aggregate and display information within 2 seconds
4. WHEN searching through large datasets THEN the system SHALL provide results quickly using optimized search indexes
5. IF query performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and provide performance diagnostics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive database indexing, so that the system can handle large amounts of data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating database indexes THEN the system SHALL index all foreign key columns and frequently queried fields
2. WHEN performing complex queries THEN the system SHALL use composite indexes for multi-column query optimization
3. WHEN implementing full-text search THEN the system SHALL create appropriate search indexes for content analysis
4. WHEN monitoring index usage THEN the system SHALL track index effectiveness and identify unused indexes
5. IF indexes become fragmented THEN the system SHALL provide maintenance procedures for index optimization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized database queries, so that the application performs well under load and scales effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing database queries THEN the system SHALL eliminate N+1 query problems through proper query optimization
2. WHEN implementing pagination THEN the system SHALL use cursor-based pagination for large datasets
3. WHEN aggregating data THEN the system SHALL use materialized views for complex analytical queries
4. WHEN caching query results THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching strategies for frequently accessed data
5. IF slow queries are detected THEN the system SHALL log and alert on queries exceeding performance thresholds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive database monitoring, so that I can proactively identify and resolve performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring database performance THEN the system SHALL provide real-time performance metrics and dashboards
2. WHEN slow queries occur THEN the system SHALL automatically log query details and execution plans
3. WHEN database resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL alert on high CPU, memory, or disk usage
4. WHEN analyzing performance trends THEN the system SHALL provide historical performance data and trend analysis
5. IF performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger automated alerts and diagnostic procedures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want database scalability planning, so that the system can handle growth in users and data volume.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning for scale THEN the system SHALL support efficient handling of millions of analysis results
2. WHEN concurrent users increase THEN the system SHALL maintain performance through proper connection pooling
3. WHEN data volume grows THEN the system SHALL implement data archiving and cleanup strategies
4. WHEN load increases THEN the system SHALL provide read replica support for query distribution
5. IF scalability limits are approached THEN the system SHALL provide capacity planning recommendations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database maintenance automation, so that the system remains performant without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing routine maintenance THEN the system SHALL automate index maintenance and statistics updates
2. WHEN cleaning up old data THEN the system SHALL implement automated data retention and archival policies
3. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL automatically identify and resolve common performance issues
4. WHEN monitoring health THEN the system SHALL perform automated database health checks and diagnostics
5. IF maintenance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and recovery procedures
