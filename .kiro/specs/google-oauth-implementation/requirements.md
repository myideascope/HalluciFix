# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves implementing a complete Google OAuth 2.0 authentication flow to replace the current mock authentication system. The implementation will enable secure user authentication and Google Drive integration with proper token management, user profile integration, and Drive API access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using my Google account, so that I can securely access the application and connect my Google Drive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Sign in with Google" THEN the system SHALL initiate a proper OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE
2. WHEN the user grants consent THEN the system SHALL handle the callback and exchange the authorization code for tokens
3. WHEN OAuth flow completes successfully THEN the system SHALL create a secure user session with proper JWT tokens
4. WHEN OAuth errors occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and recovery options
5. IF the user denies consent THEN the system SHALL handle the rejection gracefully and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication session to be managed securely, so that I don't have to repeatedly sign in and my tokens are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN access tokens are about to expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them using the refresh token
2. WHEN refresh tokens expire THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to re-authenticate
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL properly revoke all tokens and clear session data
4. WHEN tokens are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms (httpOnly cookies or encrypted storage)
5. IF concurrent refresh requests occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without token conflicts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my Google profile information to be displayed in the application, so that I have a personalized experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL fetch and display the user's profile information (name, email, avatar)
2. WHEN profile information changes THEN the system SHALL update the cached profile data appropriately
3. WHEN profile pictures fail to load THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback avatars
4. WHEN a user has multiple Google accounts THEN the system SHALL support account selection and switching
5. IF profile API calls fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade while maintaining core functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my Google Drive files through the application, so that I can analyze documents stored in my Drive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting Drive access THEN the system SHALL request only the minimal required scopes (drive.readonly)
2. WHEN Drive API is accessed THEN the system SHALL implement proper file listing with pagination support
3. WHEN users search for files THEN the system SHALL provide file search functionality with appropriate filters
4. WHEN Drive API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully with appropriate user feedback
5. IF Drive permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL request additional permissions through incremental authorization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want OAuth configuration to be secure and manageable, so that the authentication system is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring OAuth THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific redirect URIs and client configurations
2. WHEN handling OAuth callbacks THEN the system SHALL validate state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks
3. WHEN storing sensitive credentials THEN the system SHALL never expose client secrets or tokens in logs or client-side code
4. WHEN OAuth errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging while protecting user privacy
5. IF OAuth configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL prevent startup and provide clear configuration error messages
