# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves replacing all mock service implementations with real API integrations to enable production-ready functionality. The current system uses mock implementations for AI analysis, Google Drive integration, authentication, and RAG services, which need to be replaced with actual API connections to support real-world usage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the AI analysis to use real AI models instead of mock responses, so that I can get accurate hallucination detection results for my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits content for analysis THEN the system SHALL use real AI API services (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to perform the analysis
2. WHEN the AI API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages and fallback options
3. WHEN API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue requests and notify users of delays
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL return results in the same format as the current mock implementation
5. IF multiple AI providers are configured THEN the system SHALL allow users to select their preferred provider

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect to my actual Google Drive account, so that I can analyze real documents from my Drive instead of mock files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Connect Google Drive" THEN the system SHALL initiate a real OAuth 2.0 flow with Google
2. WHEN OAuth is successful THEN the system SHALL display the user's actual Drive files and folders
3. WHEN a user selects a file THEN the system SHALL download and process the real file content
4. WHEN Drive API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
5. IF a user's token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the token or prompt for re-authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication using real OAuth providers, so that my account and data are properly protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL use real OAuth providers (Google, etc.) for authentication
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create a secure session with proper JWT tokens
3. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh tokens or prompt for re-login
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL properly invalidate all tokens and clear session data
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user performing content analysis, I want the system to use real knowledge bases for fact-checking, so that the verification results are based on actual authoritative sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content analysis requires fact-checking THEN the system SHALL query real knowledge base APIs
2. WHEN knowledge sources are found THEN the system SHALL rank them by relevance and authority
3. WHEN no relevant sources are found THEN the system SHALL indicate this in the analysis results
4. WHEN knowledge base APIs are slow THEN the system SHALL implement caching to improve performance
5. IF knowledge base access fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and note the limitation in results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and monitoring for all API integrations, so that I can maintain system reliability and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API call fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns
3. WHEN service degradation occurs THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and provide fallback options
4. WHEN API costs exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL notify administrators and implement usage controls
5. IF critical APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL maintain core functionality using cached data or graceful degradation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive configuration management for all API integrations, so that the system can be deployed across different environments securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific API configurations
2. WHEN API keys are configured THEN the system SHALL store them securely and never expose them in logs
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate API connectivity before applying changes
4. WHEN invalid configurations are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent startup and provide clear error messages
5. IF backup API providers are configured THEN the system SHALL automatically failover when primary providers are unavailable
