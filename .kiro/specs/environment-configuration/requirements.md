# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves establishing a comprehensive environment variable configuration system to support development, staging, and production environments with proper security, validation, and management. The system will provide type-safe access to configuration, runtime validation, and secure handling of sensitive credentials.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a structured environment configuration system, so that I can easily manage different configurations across development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the application THEN the system SHALL support separate configurations for development, staging, and production environments
2. WHEN accessing environment variables THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe access through TypeScript interfaces
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables and fail fast with clear error messages
4. WHEN environment variables are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages indicating what needs to be configured
5. IF environment-specific overrides are needed THEN the system SHALL support local environment file overrides

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service integrations to be properly configured, so that the application can connect to external APIs and services in each environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring services THEN the system SHALL support complete configuration for Supabase, OpenAI, Google OAuth, Stripe, and monitoring services
2. WHEN API keys are configured THEN the system SHALL validate key formats and connectivity where possible
3. WHEN service configurations change THEN the system SHALL support hot reload for development environments
4. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear configuration guidance and fallback options
5. IF service accounts need setup THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive setup documentation and validation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure handling of sensitive configuration data, so that credentials and API keys are protected in all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing production secrets THEN the system SHALL use secure secret management solutions (not plain text files)
2. WHEN handling sensitive variables THEN the system SHALL never expose secrets in logs, error messages, or client-side code
3. WHEN accessing configuration THEN the system SHALL implement proper access controls and audit logging for sensitive variables
4. WHEN rotating secrets THEN the system SHALL support secret rotation without application downtime
5. IF configuration is compromised THEN the system SHALL provide procedures for secure credential rotation and incident response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an excellent development experience with configuration, so that I can quickly set up and work with the application locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up locally THEN the system SHALL provide automated setup scripts and clear documentation
2. WHEN configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with specific resolution steps
3. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support hot reload without requiring application restart
4. WHEN using feature flags THEN the system SHALL provide easy toggle mechanisms for development vs production features
5. IF setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive troubleshooting guides and diagnostic tools

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want proper configuration validation and monitoring, so that I can ensure system reliability and quickly identify configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL validate all configuration before starting the application
2. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL prevent startup and provide detailed validation errors
3. WHEN monitoring configuration health THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints for configuration validation
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL log configuration changes for audit purposes
5. IF configuration drift occurs THEN the system SHALL detect and alert on configuration inconsistencies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive feature flag support, so that I can control feature rollouts and maintain different feature sets across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL support boolean feature flags for enabling/disabling functionality
2. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL allow environment-specific feature flag configurations
3. WHEN feature flags change THEN the system SHALL support runtime feature flag updates without deployment
4. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide visibility into active feature flags and their sources
5. IF feature flags conflict THEN the system SHALL provide clear precedence rules and conflict resolution
