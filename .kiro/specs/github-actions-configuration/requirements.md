# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for properly configuring GitHub repository settings and GitHub Actions workflows with appropriate secrets management, environment variables, and security configurations for the HalluciFix application. This ensures secure, reliable, and maintainable CI/CD operations.

## Glossary

- **GitHub_Repository**: The GitHub repository hosting the HalluciFix application code
- **GitHub_Actions**: The CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub for automated workflows
- **Repository_Secrets**: Encrypted environment variables stored at the repository level in GitHub
- **Environment_Secrets**: Encrypted environment variables scoped to specific deployment environments
- **Workflow_Permissions**: Access control settings that define what actions workflows can perform
- **Branch_Protection**: Rules that enforce quality gates and review requirements for specific branches
- **Security_Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection and code analysis tools
- **Deployment_Environment**: Named environments (development, staging, production) with specific configurations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want secure secrets management in GitHub Actions, so that sensitive credentials are protected and properly scoped.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL store all sensitive credentials as encrypted Repository_Secrets
2. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL access secrets only through the secrets context and never log secret values
3. WHEN workflows require environment-specific secrets, THE GitHub_Repository SHALL use Environment_Secrets with appropriate access controls
4. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL implement secret rotation procedures with automated validation
5. WHERE secrets are no longer needed, THE GitHub_Repository SHALL provide automated cleanup and removal processes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive security configurations for GitHub Actions, so that the CI/CD pipeline is protected against common attack vectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL use minimal required permissions for each workflow job
2. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL restrict workflow permissions to prevent privilege escalation
3. WHEN external actions are used, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL pin actions to specific commit SHAs or verified versions
4. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL enable security scanning and vulnerability alerts for all workflows
5. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL validate all inputs and sanitize outputs to prevent injection attacks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want properly configured branch protection rules, so that code quality and security standards are enforced before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL require pull request reviews before merging to main and develop branches
2. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL require status checks to pass before allowing branch merges
3. WHEN pull requests are created, THE GitHub_Repository SHALL require up-to-date branches before merging
4. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL restrict push access to protected branches to authorized users only
5. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL require signed commits for all changes to production branches

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want environment-specific deployment configurations, so that different environments have appropriate access controls and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL define separate environments for development, staging, and production
2. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL require manual approval for production deployments
3. WHEN deploying to production, THE GitHub_Repository SHALL require approval from designated reviewers
4. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL implement deployment protection rules with time-based restrictions
5. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL maintain audit logs for all environment deployments and approvals

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want audit logging and monitoring for all GitHub Actions activities, so that we can track and review all CI/CD operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL enable audit logging for all workflow executions and secret access
2. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL generate detailed logs for all deployment and configuration changes
3. WHEN sensitive operations are performed, THE GitHub_Repository SHALL create audit trail entries with user attribution
4. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL retain audit logs for minimum 90 days for compliance review
5. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL provide automated alerts for suspicious or unauthorized activities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized environment variable management, so that configuration is consistent across all environments and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL use consistent environment variable naming conventions across all workflows
2. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL validate required environment variables before workflow execution
3. WHEN environment variables change, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL provide automated validation and testing
4. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL document all environment variables with their purpose and expected values
5. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL provide fallback values or clear error messages for missing required variables

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want automated security scanning integrated into GitHub Actions, so that vulnerabilities are detected early in the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL perform dependency vulnerability scanning on every pull request
2. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL enable CodeQL analysis for automated code security scanning
3. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL block deployment and create security alerts
4. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL implement secret scanning to prevent accidental credential exposure
5. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL generate security reports and integrate with security monitoring tools

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want reliable workflow execution with proper error handling, so that CI/CD operations are resilient and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL implement retry mechanisms for transient failures with exponential backoff
2. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information for workflow failures
3. WHEN workflows fail, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL preserve artifacts and logs for troubleshooting
4. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL implement workflow monitoring with automated alerting for persistent failures
5. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL provide rollback capabilities for failed deployments with automated recovery procedures

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want notification and communication integration, so that the team is informed about CI/CD status and issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL send notifications to Slack channels for deployment status and failures
2. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL create GitHub issues automatically for persistent workflow failures
3. WHEN critical security vulnerabilities are detected, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL send immediate alerts to security team
4. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL provide status badges and dashboards for workflow health monitoring
5. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL generate weekly reports summarizing CI/CD metrics and health status

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient resource utilization in GitHub Actions, so that workflow execution is fast and cost-effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL implement intelligent caching strategies for dependencies and build artifacts
2. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL use appropriate runner types and sizes based on workflow requirements
3. WHEN workflows can be parallelized, THE GitHub_Actions SHALL distribute work across multiple runners efficiently
4. THE GitHub_Repository SHALL monitor and optimize workflow execution time and resource consumption
5. THE GitHub_Actions SHALL implement workflow cancellation for outdated runs to conserve resources
