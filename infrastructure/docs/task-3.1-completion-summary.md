# Task 3.1 Completion Summary: Create Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool

## ✅ Task Completed Successfully

**Task**: 3.1 Create Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool  
**Status**: Completed  
**Date**: October 28, 2024  

## What Was Implemented

### 1. AWS Cognito User Pool
- **Name**: `hallucifix-users-dev`
- **Features Configured**:
  - Email-based sign-in
  - Self-registration enabled
  - Email verification required
  - Strong password policy (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
  - Optional MFA (SMS and TOTP support)
  - Account recovery via email
  - Custom attributes for subscription tier and usage quota

### 2. Google OAuth Integration
- **Provider**: Google OAuth 2.0
- **Scopes**: email, profile, openid, Google Drive read access
- **Status**: Infrastructure ready (requires Google credentials)
- **Attribute Mapping**: Email, given name, family name

### 3. Cognito User Pool Client
- **Name**: `hallucifix-client-dev`
- **Configuration**:
  - Web application (no client secret)
  - SRP and password authentication flows
  - OAuth authorization code and implicit grants
  - Callback URLs configured for development

### 4. Cognito User Pool Domain
- **Purpose**: OAuth endpoints and hosted UI
- **Domain**: Auto-generated with random suffix
- **Status**: Ready for OAuth flows

### 5. Cognito Identity Pool
- **Name**: `hallucifix_identity_pool_dev`
- **Configuration**:
  - Authenticated identities only
  - Integrated with User Pool
  - Google federated login support
  - IAM role mapping for AWS resource access

### 6. IAM Roles and Permissions
- **Authenticated Role**: Created for logged-in users
- **Permissions**:
  - Cognito Sync and Identity access
  - S3 access for user-specific file uploads
  - Scoped to user's own resources

## Infrastructure Files Created

### CDK Stack Files
- `infrastructure/lib/cognito-stack.ts` - Dedicated Cognito stack
- `infrastructure/bin/cognito-only.ts` - Standalone deployment script

### Configuration Files
- `infrastructure/config/oauth-config.json` - Google OAuth setup guide
- `infrastructure/scripts/deploy-cognito.sh` - Deployment script
- `infrastructure/docs/cognito-setup.md` - Complete setup documentation

## AWS Resources Created

The following AWS resources were successfully deployed:

1. **Cognito User Pool** - User authentication and management
2. **Cognito User Pool Client** - Application integration
3. **Cognito User Pool Domain** - OAuth endpoints
4. **Cognito Identity Pool** - AWS credentials for users
5. **Google Identity Provider** - OAuth integration (pending credentials)
6. **IAM Role** - Permissions for authenticated users
7. **Identity Pool Role Attachment** - Role mapping

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Google OAuth Setup
- Create Google Cloud Console project
- Enable Google+ API and Google Drive API
- Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
- Update CDK stack with real credentials
- Redeploy to activate Google integration

### 2. Frontend Integration
- Install AWS Amplify Auth library
- Configure Amplify with Cognito settings
- Update existing useAuth hook
- Test authentication flows

### 3. Environment Variables
After deployment, these values are available for frontend configuration:
- `VITE_USER_POOL_ID`
- `VITE_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID`
- `VITE_IDENTITY_POOL_ID`
- `VITE_USER_POOL_DOMAIN`

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check stack status
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name Hallucifix-Cognito-dev --profile hallucifix

# List Cognito User Pools
aws cognito-idp list-user-pools --max-items 10 --profile hallucifix

# List Identity Pools
aws cognito-identity list-identity-pools --max-results 10 --profile hallucifix
```

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the specification:

- ✅ **Requirement 1.1**: AWS Cognito processes login requests
- ✅ **Requirement 1.3**: OAuth integration with Google Drive
- ✅ **Requirement 1.4**: Multi-factor authentication capabilities
- ✅ **Requirement 8.1**: Least privilege IAM roles and policies
- ✅ **Requirement 8.2**: Secure credential management

## Security Features Implemented

- Password complexity requirements
- Email verification mandatory
- Optional MFA with SMS and TOTP
- Least privilege IAM permissions
- User-scoped S3 access patterns
- Secure OAuth integration ready

## Cost Optimization

- Development environment configuration
- Minimal resource allocation
- Pay-per-use Cognito pricing model
- No unnecessary premium features enabled

The Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool infrastructure is now ready for the next phase of the migration: frontend integration and user data migration.
