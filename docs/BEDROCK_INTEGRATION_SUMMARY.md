# AWS Bedrock Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive AWS Bedrock integration for HalluciFix's AI content analysis system, replacing existing AI providers with AWS Bedrock foundation models while maintaining full functionality and adding enhanced monitoring capabilities.

## Completed Tasks

### 7.1 Set up AWS Bedrock integration ✅

**IAM Configuration:**
- Created `infrastructure/config/bedrock-iam-policy.json` with comprehensive Bedrock permissions
- Implemented `infrastructure/lib/bedrock-stack.ts` CDK stack for IAM roles and policies
- Configured least-privilege access for Bedrock model invocation, monitoring, and logging

**AWS Configuration:**
- Enhanced `src/lib/aws-config.ts` with Bedrock-specific configuration
- Added credential management with fallback to AWS credential chain
- Implemented configuration validation for Bedrock settings

**Provider Implementation:**
- Enhanced existing `src/lib/providers/bedrock/BedrockProvider.ts` with:
  - Intelligent model selection based on content characteristics
  - Enhanced error handling with Bedrock-specific error messages
  - Cost calculation for different Claude 3 models
  - Comprehensive logging and performance tracking

### 7.2 Update analysis service to use AWS AI services ✅

**Service Layer:**
- Created `src/lib/providers/bedrock/BedrockService.ts` high-level service with:
  - Cost tracking and daily limits
  - Rate limiting and quota management
  - Caching for improved performance
  - Health monitoring and status reporting

**Analysis Service Integration:**
- Updated `src/lib/analysisService.ts` to use Bedrock as primary provider
- Implemented comprehensive fallback logic:
  1. AWS Bedrock (primary)
  2. Provider Manager (fallback providers)
  3. Legacy HalluciFix API
  4. Mock analysis (final fallback)
- Added cost monitoring integration with existing cost tracking service

**Configuration Management:**
- Created `src/lib/providers/AIProviderConfig.ts` for intelligent model selection
- Implemented model recommendation system based on:
  - Content length and complexity
  - Sensitivity requirements
  - Cost constraints
  - Performance needs

### 7.4 Create AI service performance monitoring ✅

**Bedrock-Specific Monitoring:**
- Created `src/lib/monitoring/BedrockMonitoringService.ts` with:
  - Real-time performance metrics tracking
  - AWS CloudWatch integration for metrics publishing
  - Service quota monitoring and alerting
  - Cost analysis and trend tracking
  - Comprehensive alert system for various thresholds

**Monitoring Dashboard:**
- Implemented `src/components/BedrockMonitoringDashboard.tsx` React component with:
  - Real-time health status display
  - Model-specific performance metrics
  - Cost breakdown and projections
  - Alert management interface
  - Token usage analytics

**Integration with Existing Systems:**
- Enhanced Bedrock provider to record monitoring metrics
- Integrated with existing AI performance monitoring service
- Added CloudWatch metrics publishing for AWS-native monitoring
