- **Purpose**: Monitors test execution performance and identifies bottlenecks
- **Features**:
  - Measures test execution times and efficiency
  - Identifies slow tests and performance bottlenecks
  - Tracks performance trends over time
  - Checks performance thresholds and violations
  - Generates optimization recommendations

#### Test Dashboard (`scripts/test-dashboard.cjs`)
- **Purpose**: Provides comprehensive testing insights dashboard
- **Features**:
  - Combines health, performance, and coverage data
  - Generates interactive HTML dashboard
  - Provides markdown summary reports
  - Shows test suite configuration status
  - Displays trends and recommendations

## Package.json Scripts Added

The following npm scripts were added to make the monitoring tools easily accessible:

```json
{
  "test:health": "node scripts/test-health-monitor.cjs",
  "test:health:quick": "node scripts/test-health-monitor.cjs --quick",
  "test:maintenance": "node scripts/test-maintenance.cjs",
  "test:maintenance:cleanup": "node scripts/test-maintenance.cjs --cleanup-only",
  "test:performance:monitor": "node scripts/test-performance-monitor.cjs",
  "test:performance:quick": "node scripts/test-performance-monitor.cjs --quick",
  "test:dashboard": "node scripts/test-dashboard.cjs",
  "test:dashboard:quick": "node scripts/test-dashboard.cjs --quick"
}
```

## Generated Outputs

### Performance Monitoring
- **Location**: `.test-performance/`
- **Files**:
  - `benchmarks.json` - Current performance benchmarks
  - `trends.json` - Performance trend data
  - `performance-report.md` - Detailed performance analysis

### Maintenance Reports
- **Location**: `test-maintenance-report.md` (project root)
- **Content**: Maintenance actions performed and recommendations

- Identifies unused utilities and duplicate tests
- Suggests improvements to test organization

### 4. Comprehensive Reporting
- HTML dashboard for visual insights
- Markdown reports for documentation
- JSON data for programmatic access
- Trend analysis and recommendations

### 5. Integration with Existing Infrastructure
