# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for HalluciFix, an AI Accuracy Verification Engine. Our testing approach ensures high-quality, reliable software through multiple layers of automated testing, continuous integration, and intelligent quality gates.

## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Test-Driven Quality**: Every feature must have corresponding tests before deployment
2. **Risk-Based Testing**: Critical paths receive the highest test coverage and attention
3. **Shift-Left Testing**: Catch issues early in the development cycle
4. **Continuous Feedback**: Rapid feedback loops for developers and stakeholders
5. **Intelligent Automation**: Smart test selection and execution optimization

### Quality Standards

- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% overall code coverage
- **Critical Module Coverage**: 90% for authentication, payment, and analysis services
- **Performance Standards**: All tests must complete within 15 minutes
- **Reliability**: Flaky test rate below 2%

## Testing Pyramid

### Unit Tests (Foundation - 70%)
