## üöÄ Usage

### Using Dynamic Runner Selection

Add to your workflow jobs:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ steps.select-runner.outputs.runner-type }}
    steps:
      - name: Select Optimal Runner
        id: select-runner
        uses: ./.github/actions/select-optimal-runner
        with:
          workload-type: 'unit-tests'
          estimated-duration: '10'
          priority: 'normal'
          policy: 'cost-optimization'
      
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # Your workflow steps...
```
