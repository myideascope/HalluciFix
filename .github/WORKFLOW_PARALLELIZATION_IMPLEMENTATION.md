## üéØ Key Features

### Intelligent Job Parallelization
- **Change-based analysis**: Determines optimal parallelization based on code changes
- **Dynamic test grouping**: Groups tests by execution time and dependencies
- **Resource-aware allocation**: Selects appropriate runner types for each test group

```json
{
  "filePatterns": {
    "frontend": {
      "patterns": ["src/components/**", "src/pages/**", "*.tsx", "*.css"],
      "requiredTests": ["unit-tests", "component-tests", "visual-tests"],
      "optionalTests": ["e2e-tests"]
    },
    "backend": {
      "patterns": ["src/lib/**", "src/api/**", "supabase/functions/**"],
      "requiredTests": ["unit-tests", "integration-tests", "api-tests"],

      "requiredTests": ["integration-tests", "migration-tests"],
      "optionalTests": ["performance-tests"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cancellation Policies

```json
{
  "prUpdates": {
    "enabled": true,
    "concurrencyGroup": "pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}",
    "cancelInProgress": true,
    "applicableWorkflows": ["test", "security", "quality-gates"]

## üöÄ Usage

### Using the Optimized CI Pipeline

The optimized CI pipeline automatically activates when:
- Pull requests are opened or updated
- Commits are pushed to main/develop branches
- Manual workflow dispatch is triggered

```yaml
# Automatic optimization based on changes
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      force_full_suite:
        description: 'Force full test suite execution'
        type: boolean
```

### Using Smart Test Selection Action

```yaml
jobs:
  select-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Smart Test Selection
        id: tests
        uses: ./.github/actions/smart-test-selection
        with:
          base-ref: 'main'
          force-full-suite: 'false'
      
      - name: Run Selected Tests
        run: |
          echo "Selected tests: ${{ steps.tests.outputs.selected-tests }}"
          echo "Change impact: ${{ steps.tests.outputs.change-impact }}"
```

### Using Workflow Cancellation Management

```yaml
jobs:
  cancel-outdated:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Cancel Outdated Workflows
        uses: ./.github/actions/manage-workflow-cancellation
        with:
          cancellation-policy: 'pr-updates'
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          max-concurrent: '10'
```

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Create a file with changed files
echo -e "src/components/Button.tsx\nsrc/lib/api.ts\npackage.json" > changes.txt

# Analyze changes
node .github/scripts/workflow-parallelization-optimizer.cjs analyze changes.txt
