   - Market readiness

2. **Technical Risk** (Weight: 25%)
   - Implementation complexity
   - Dependency on external services
   - Potential for breaking changes
   - Security implications

3. **User Value** (Weight: 20%)
   - Direct user benefit
   - Feature completeness
   - User satisfaction impact
   - Adoption likelihood

4. **Development Effort** (Weight: 15%)
   - Time to implement
   - Resource requirements
   - Team expertise needed
   - Testing complexity

5. **Dependencies** (Weight: 10%)
   - Blocks other features

## ðŸš€ Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 0: Foundation (Week 1)
**Must complete before any other work**

#### 1. Environment Configuration (P0)
- **Why First**: Blocks all other development
- **Impact**: Enables real service integration
- **Risk**: Low complexity, high dependency blocker
- **Timeline**: 3-5 days

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Weeks 2-4)
**Essential for MVP launch**

#### 2. Replace Mock Services (P0)
- **Why Second**: Core product functionality
- **Impact**: Transforms demo into real product
- **Dependencies**: Requires environment config
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

#### 3. Google OAuth Implementation (P0)
- **Why Third**: User authentication foundation
- **Impact**: Enables secure user management
- **Dependencies**: Can start after environment setup
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks (parallel with mock services)

### Phase 2: Reliability & Quality (Weeks 4-6)
**Production readiness**

#### 4. Error Boundaries & Handling (P1)
- **Why Fourth**: Production stability
- **Impact**: User experience and reliability
- **Dependencies**: Should follow core functionality
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

#### 5. Comprehensive Testing (P1)
- **Why Fifth**: Quality assurance
- **Impact**: Confidence in deployments
- **Dependencies**: Easier after core features stable
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks (ongoing)

### Phase 3: Monetization (Weeks 6-9)
**Revenue generation**

#### 6. Stripe Payment Integration (P2)
- **Why Last**: Revenue important but not blocking
- **Impact**: Enables business model
- **Dependencies**: Requires stable core product
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Decision Framework

### Choose P0 (Critical) When:
- âœ… Blocks other development work
- âœ… Required for basic product functionality
- âœ… High user impact with manageable risk
- âœ… Foundation for other features

### Choose P1 (High) When:
- âœ… Significantly improves user experience
- âœ… Reduces technical debt or risk
- âœ… Enables important but not critical features
- âœ… Good ROI on development time

### Choose P2 (Medium) When:
- âœ… Nice-to-have improvements
- âœ… Revenue generating but not immediately critical
- âœ… Can be delayed without major impact
- âœ… Requires significant effort for incremental benefit

## ðŸ”„ Alternative Prioritization Strategies

### Strategy A: Revenue-First Approach
*If immediate monetization is critical*

1. Environment Configuration (P0)
2. Stripe Payment Integration (P2) 
3. Replace Mock Services (P0)
4. Google OAuth Implementation (P0)
5. Error Boundaries & Handling (P1)
6. Comprehensive Testing (P1)

**Pros**: Faster path to revenue
**Cons**: Higher technical risk, less stable foundation

### Strategy B: Risk-Minimization Approach
*If stability is paramount*

1. Environment Configuration (P0)
2. Comprehensive Testing (P1)
3. Error Boundaries & Handling (P1)
4. Replace Mock Services (P0)
5. Google OAuth Implementation (P0)
6. Stripe Payment Integration (P2)

**Pros**: Lower risk, more stable development
**Cons**: Slower time to market, delayed revenue

### Strategy C: Parallel Development Approach
*If you have multiple developers*

**Team A (Backend Focus)**:
1. Environment Configuration
2. Replace Mock Services
3. Stripe Payment Integration

**Team B (Frontend/Quality Focus)**:
1. Google OAuth Implementation
2. Error Boundaries & Handling
3. Comprehensive Testing

**Pros**: Faster overall completion
**Cons**: Requires coordination, potential integration issues

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Checklist

### Before Starting Any Spec:
- [ ] Review dependencies and prerequisites
- [ ] Ensure team has required expertise
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create feature branch and tracking

### During Implementation:
- [ ] Follow spec acceptance criteria
- [ ] Regular progress check-ins
- [ ] Test incrementally
- [ ] Document decisions and changes

### Before Moving to Next Spec:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Stakeholder approval

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics by Phase

### Phase 0 Success:
- [ ] All services can connect with real credentials
- [ ] Development environment setup < 15 minutes
- [ ] Zero configuration-related errors

### Phase 1 Success:
- [ ] Real AI analysis working end-to-end
- [ ] User authentication flow complete
- [ ] Core features functional without mocks

### Phase 2 Success:
- [ ] Error rate < 1% in production
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] User-friendly error handling

### Phase 3 Success:
- [ ] Payment processing functional
- [ ] Subscription management working
- [ ] Revenue generation enabled

## ðŸš¨ Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items:
1. **Mock Service Replacement**: Plan for gradual rollout with feature flags
2. **Payment Integration**: Thorough testing in sandbox environment
3. **OAuth Implementation**: Security review before production

### Contingency Plans:
- Keep mock services as fallback during transition
- Implement feature flags for easy rollback
- Have monitoring and alerting ready
- Plan for gradual user migration

## ðŸ“ž Decision Support

### When to Deviate from Recommended Order:
- **Investor demo needed**: Prioritize visual/functional improvements
- **Security audit required**: Move error handling and testing up
- **Revenue pressure**: Consider revenue-first strategy
- **Team constraints**: Adjust based on available expertise

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- ðŸš© Skipping environment setup (will cause problems later)
- ðŸš© Implementing payments before core stability
- ðŸš© Ignoring error handling until the end
- ðŸš© No testing strategy throughout development

**Recommendation**: Follow the standard Phase 0 â†’ Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2 â†’ Phase 3 approach unless you have specific business constraints that require deviation.
